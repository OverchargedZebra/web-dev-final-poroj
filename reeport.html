                    Introduction: Tekken is an extremely brutal game which leaves players punished heavily for a single mistake. The purpose of my site is to allow new tekken players to learn the basics of Tekken and choose the character they want to be with them during the journey of learning one of the most technical skill demanding fighting game.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The things that have inspired me the most are: <br><br>

                    &#x2022;    The game Tekken itself, I have been a huge fan of Tekken since I played Tekken 5 with my relatives. Fighting games are a great way to compete with friends and other players online. There is a large and active fighting game community, and it is easy to find people to play against. <br><br>

                    &#x2022;    Arslan Ash, the person that is actively bringing Pakistan to international E-sports attention. He is the only person in the history of Tekken to win 4 EVO tournaments, which are one of the most intense competition each year. <br><br>

                    &#x2022;    The website that inspired me is called <a href="https://dashfight.com/">dashfight</a>, it is a beautiful website designed to be easy on the eyes and is also a great entry way for new players to get started on all sorts of fighting games and not only Tekken.<br>
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accessibility: <br><br>
                    
                    &#x2022;    It provides support for both desktop and smartphone user.<br><br>
                    &#x2022;    The text is large with less disrupting elements to keep the user focused.<br><br>
                    &#x2022;    One handed use design in mindset.<br>

                    Usability: <br><br>
                    &#x2022;    Making the menu to be easy to use for both desktop and smartphone users<br><br>
                    &#x2022;    Allowing the moving of tiles in homepage for different device users<br><br>
                    &#x2022;    The header being available in every html for easy moving around different webpages pf website<br><br>

                <h2>
                    Learning: <br><br>
                    &#x2022;    I learnt that CSS is extremely finicky and making any slight changes to a parent element complately changes the behaviour of its child elements<br><br>
                    &#x2022;    I learnt how to use the decorater @media in CSS to make my website to be responsive in smartphone devices as well<br><br>
                    &#x2022;    How to embed links in div, to allow for interactive html elements<br><br>

                <h2>
                    Evaluation I: <br><br>
                    &#x2022;    I think this is a basic prototype of a website which could be useful for new players since Tekken 8 release date has been announced<br><br>
                    &#x2022;    I was successful in making the website smartphone device friendly, thanks to moving of tiles in homepage and menue Which adapts size correctly<br><br>
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Evaluation II:<br><br>
                    I wanted to automate the method of article page generation, I would give a text document and a programming language would have been used to automate most of the creation. This ended up taking a majority of my development time with nothing to show for it. If I would have to do it again I would focus on producing a more functioning website rather then waste my time on something which was not needed and in the end being a huge blunder<br><br>
